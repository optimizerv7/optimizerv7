My name is Vignesh Perumal. My interests and expertise lie in designing and implementing custom machine learning solutions addressing engineering requirements that drive R&D efforts in high-tech and deep-tech. My current focus is on AI-enabled design & engineering optimization. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University with a research focus on developing faster computational  techniques for using experimental and simulation data to inform designs for Additive Manufacturing (AM). This led to the development of AI-enabled design workflow for Additive Manufacturing that can be used for predicting for predicting novel design outcomes using Generative AI. Prior to this, my research focus was in developing computational models characterizing mesoscale behavior of aerospace-grade aluminum alloys to  understand the relation between particle fracture and elastic wave propagation.
